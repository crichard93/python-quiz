# quiz  
A small quiz that I built to review concepts learned about using Python. There are  
3 difficulty levels for now: **easy**, **medium**, and **hard**. The user will receive  
5 attempts per question.  

## Running the quiz  
Download the **quiz.py* file and open the command line interface. Navigate to the  
directory containing the **quiz.py** file and enter 'python -i quiz.py' to begin the quiz.
